### Purpose
This web application was inspired from a page in a 1st grade mathematics workbook that provided supplementary problems for my daughter after school. In it, children were expected to match solved mathematical equations with their solutions. My inspiration was to go beyond and first make the child solve the expression. Second, they match the corresponding letter with a blank solution provided at the bottom, decoding the encrypted message at the bottom. Third, the web app would take any arbitrary input and generate a solution set with a unique key with no repeating solutions. Here, the Math Decoder was born.

### Mission
My main priority when developing this web application was to build something that would help my daughter with her mathematics. She was my target audience and I tailored the experience in her favor. I however made it generic enough to be useable by everyone. Making the source open and hosting it for free on my website [www.ericmcd.com](https://www.ericmcd.com), it's free and available for everyone to use without restrictions. With a goal of promoting mathematics in early childhood education, I am thrilled to have an opportunity to share something that would be creative and engaging for children to work on while still practicing necessary skills.

### Usage
+ There are five difficulty levels to choose from. Select one of the radio buttons to proceed.
+ Provide a message of no more than 20 characters for difficulty one, or 42 characters for difficulties two through five in the `Secret Message` input field. This will be the encrypted message hidden at the bottom that the child must decrypt.
+ You may optionally enter a message in the `Optional Message` input field below. This is a prompt that would show at the top of the page, such as a question at the top if the decrypted message were to be the answer to the question. This is not required.
+ Press `Encrypt`, or press enter from any of the input fields. The application will generate the solution set and problems.

### Difficulty Level Descriptions
| Level | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Level 1` | Addition and Subtraction. Between 0 through 20. Intended for kindergarteners |
| `Level 2` | Addition and Subtraction. Up to double-digit problem sets |
| `Level 3` | Addition and Subtraction. Up to triple-digit problem sets |
| `Level 4` | Multiplication and Division. Up to double-digit problem sets |
| `Level 5` | Multiplication and Division. Up to triple-digit problem sets |

## The Ultimate Goal: Create Usable Worksheets
The purpose of this application is to create printable worksheets. After the problems and solution set is generated and displayed to the window, print the page using your preferred printer. The web app uses a custom printer media stylesheet that will render the text for printers as well as it can, so no alterations are necessary.
